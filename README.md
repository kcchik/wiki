# Wiki

An attempt at a small, but usable wiki engine.

### Requirements
- Node.js
- Yarn

### Installing
Put `.md` files in the `pages` directory.

Install dependencies and start
```sh
yarn

yarn start
```

### Why
I created this wiki because I wanted to host something very minimal. Couldn't find anything out there quite as lacking in features as I wanted. Here are some of this wiki's (lack of) features:
- No framework
- No client-side JS
- 2 dependencies (Postgres and markdown)

Behold - My tiny wiki. It's not as small as [this](https://github.com/jimenezrick/wi-wiki), but I think I did alright.

I should not have made this.
