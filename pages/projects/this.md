# This

I created this wiki because I wanted to host something very minimal. Couldn't find anything out there quite as lacking in features as I wanted. Here were some of my unreasonable criteria:
- No frameworks: They take up too much space.
- Minimal dependencies: They take up too much space.
- Markdown support: Makes notes look good and it's simple.
- Nice UI: Personal preference so doing it myself is best.

Behold - My tiny wiki. Although not as small as [this](https://github.com/jimenezrick/wi-wiki), I think I did alright. No framework, one dependency (it's for markdown and it's good so I made an exception).

I should not have made this.

Uploading is a pain: This wiki is static so I need to deploy everytime I want to change a page.

No private pages: If I want to upload something for __me__ and not for anyone else, it doesn't work.

Eventually, I want to go down one of two paths:
1. Keep this static and generate HTML files instead of converting from markdown everytime a page loads
2. Make it a real wiki with private pages and search and client side page editing
