# Wiki

An attempt at a small, but usable wiki engine.

### Requirements
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn

### Installing
Create a PostgreSQL database

Create and populate the `.env` file
```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

Install dependencies and build
```sh
yarn

yarn run build
```

### Running
```sh
yarn start
```

### Why
I created this wiki because I wanted to host something very minimal. Couldn't find anything out there quite as lacking in features as I wanted. Here are some of this wiki's (lack of) features:
- No framework
- No client-side JS
- Minimal dependencies

Behold - My tiny wiki. I should not have made this.
