# Wiki

An attempt at a small, but usable wiki engine.

### Requirements
- Node.js
- Postgres
- Yarn

### Installing
Create a database and set `DATABASE_URL`

Install dependencies and start
```sh
yarn

node build.js

yarn start
```

### Why
I created this wiki because I wanted to host something very minimal. Couldn't find anything out there quite as lacking in features as I wanted. Here are some of this wiki's (lack of) features:
- No framework
- No client-side JS
- 2 dependencies (Postgres and markdown)

Behold - My tiny wiki. It's not as small as [this](https://github.com/jimenezrick/wi-wiki), but I think I did alright.

I should not have made this.
